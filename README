This directory contains all the resources and the tools that compose the "Paralle Data Mining Workflow" described
in the ACCURAT deliverable D2.6. Version 2.
The present bundle is compiled for ONLY FOR Windows systems (!) and contains the following tools:

Requirements:
- 'perl' and 'java' must be in the %PATH%.
- IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that for EMACC and PEXACC, the user edits the cluster.info  (see D2.6 for that) file and run on multiple CPU cores since
both algorithms are CPU intesive.
- be sure to uset the environment variable USER to your user in cmd.exe! That is, 'echo %USER%' MUST NOT BE VOID! GIZA++ breaks if this does not happen.
